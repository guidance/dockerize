# Guidance Dockerize

## Purpose

Guidance Dockerize is a set of configuration files that allow you to dockerize applications for local development and beyond.

## Usage

**Setup**
The setup.sh script is used when you have a application that you want to dockerize. You run this and it copies the files from the 
application folders to your project application folders.

**Update**
The update.sh script is used when you want to take the files from your project application and move them back to dockerize to 
contribute your changes.
